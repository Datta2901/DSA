## The number of binary trees can be formed by given n nodes(not labelled) is

* $$ \frac{^{2n}C_n} {n + 1}$$ --> This is also known as catalan number

## The number of binary trees having maximum height is 

* $$ 2 ^ {n - 1} $$

## The number of binary trees can be formed by given n nodes(labelled) is

*   $$ \frac{^{2n}C_n} {n + 1} * n! $$

### If number of nodes are given then what is the maximum and minimum height possible in a binary tree

Min height is 

* $$ log_2(n + 1) - 1$$

* Maximum Height possible is $$ n - 1 $$

* In a binary tree
    here deg means degree
    $$ deg(0) = deg(2) + 1 $$
